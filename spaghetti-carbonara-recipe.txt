Spaghetti
4 eggs
200gr bacon chopped in cubes

We use 1 egg and the inner yellow from the other 3. We cook the bacon well in a pan then we let it to
cool down and have room temperature. We add a lot of pepper. 
We boil the spaghetti al-dente.
In a cool bowl, preferably metal or glass, we put the bacon and the well-mixed eggs. Then we add the hot spaghetti
and mix well. So simple, so delicious!!!
